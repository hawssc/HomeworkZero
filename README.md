This program prints out an Android message in the logcat  whenever the app calls a lifecycle method such as onCreate, onResume, or onStop.
When the Android Device turns from Portrait to landscape and vice versa, the App is suspended and rebuilt. The onPause onSaveInstanceState onStop onDestroy onCreate onRestoreInstanceState onResume and onCreateOptionsMenu methods are called.
